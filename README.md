# basicFlutterApp

I just tried to edit the basic or say the default flutter app we all get pre-built while creating a flutter app.
I tried to add a button with which we can reset the counter in the app which was missing there.Initially the users could only increase the counter but couldn't reset it. So I tried to give the functionlity to reset the counter to this app.
